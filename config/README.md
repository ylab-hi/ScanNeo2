# General Configuration

Configure ScanNeo2 by editing the `config/config.yml` file. Make sure to adjust parameters to suit your needs and data. 
Note that the paths in the config file need to be relative to the directory from which you run snakemake. 

For a detailed description of the parameters, please refer to section about 
the [configuration](https://github.com/ylab-hi/ScanNeo2/wiki/Configuration) in the wiki. Different locations of 
configuration files can be specified using `--configfile config.yaml`.
